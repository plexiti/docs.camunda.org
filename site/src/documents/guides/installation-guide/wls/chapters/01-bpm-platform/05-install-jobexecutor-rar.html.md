In this section, we explain how the camunda-oracle-weblogic-rar module can be installed using the WebLogic Server Administration Console.

The installation process is composed of three steps:

1. Install the <code>camunda-oracle-weblogic-rar-$PLATFORM_VERSION.rar</code> RAR file.
2. Configure the deployment order.
3. Configure the RAR-scoped JCA Work Manager to your needs.


## Installing the RAR file

First, the <code>camunda-oracle-weblogic-rar-$PLATFORM_VERSION.rar</code> RAR file must be installed:

1. Open the WebLogic Server Administration Console.
2. Navigate to the **"Domain structure / YOUR_DOMAIN / Deployments"** page.
3. Select the **"Install"** button.
4. Using the File Browser, select the <code>camunda-oracle-weblogic-rar-$PLATFORM_VERSION.rar</code> from the modules folder of the camunda BPM platform for Oracle Weblogic Application Server distribution and continue to the **"Next"** page.
5. Select **"Install this deployment as an application"** and continue to the **"Next"** page.
6. Fill in a name for the resource adapter deployment, we propose <code>camunda-oracle-weblogic-rar</code>.
7. Continue to the **"Next"** page.
8. Select **"Yes, take me to the deployment's configuration screen"** and click the **"Finish"** button to complete the installation.


## Configure the deployment order

1. In the deployment's configuration screen, change the value of the **"Deployment Order"** from **"100"** to **"80"**, so the Resource Adapter starts before the usual deployments.
2. Click **"Save"** to persist the change.  


Example: Deployment order set to **"80"**.

</a>  


## Configure the JCA Work Manager

1. In the deployment's configuration screen, select the **"Configuration"** tab.
2. Now select the newly available **"Workload"** tab.
3. Here, you should see a preconfigured JCA Work Manager named **"wm/camunda-bpm-workmanager"**. Click on it.
4. Select for **"Minimum Threads Constraint"** the preconfigured **"camunda-bpm-workmanager-min-threads"** option. Per default, we configure 2 threads as a minimum. **At least 2 threads are required**, but you can increase them when you think you do alot of asynchronous work.
5. Select for **"Maximum Threads Constraint"** the preconfigured **"camunda-bpm-workmanager-max-threads"** option. Per default, we configure 5 threads, but you can increase them when you think you do alot of asynchronous work.
6. For the **"Stuck Thread Action"**, select **"Ignore stuck threads"**, because we have a long running daemon thread which aquires the jobs to execute. This forces WebLogic to skip the Stuck Thread Warning every ten minutes in the server log.
7. Click **"Save"** to persist your changes.  


Workload tab of camunda-oracle-weblogic-rar deployment:

This completes the installation of the resource adapter.
