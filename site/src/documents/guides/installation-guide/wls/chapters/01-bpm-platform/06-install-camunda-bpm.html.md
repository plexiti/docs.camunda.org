In this section, we explain how the camunda-oracle-weblogic-ear module can be installed using the WebLogic Server Administration Console.

The installation process is composed of two steps:

1. Install the <code>camunda-oracle-weblogic-ear-$PLATFORM_VERSION.ear</code> EAR file.
2. Configure the deployment order of <code>camunda-oracle-weblogic-ear-$PLATFORM_VERSION.ear</code> EAR file.


## Installing the EAR file

First, the <code>camunda-oracle-weblogic-ear-$PLATFORM_VERSION.ear</code> RAR file must be installed:

1. Open the WebLogic Server Administration Console.
2. Navigate to the **"Domain structure / YOUR_DOMAIN / Deployments"** page.
3. Select the **"Install"** button.
4. Using the File Browser, select the <code>camunda-oracle-weblogic-ear-$PLATFORM_VERSION.ear</code> from the modules folder of the camunda BPM platform for Oracle Weblogic Application Server distribution and continue to the **"Next"** page.
5. Select **"Install this deployment as an application"** and continue to the **"Next"** page.
6. Fill in <code>camunda-bpm-platform</code> as name for the enterprise application deployment. This setting is **mandatory** and MUST NOT be changed.

  </a>

7. Continue to the **"Next"** page.
8. Select **"Yes, take me to the deployment's configuration screen"** and click the **"Finish"** button to complete the installation.


## Configure the deployment order

1. In the deployment's configuration screen, change the value of the **"Deployment Order"** from **"100"** to **"90"**, so the Enterprise Application starts after the Resource Adapter but before the process application deployments.
2. Click **"Save"** to persist the change.
3. Start the camunda-bpm-platform application if it is not already. If this fails initially, try to restart the server. The resource adapter references are not always resolved properly. It will be fine after a restart.



Example: Deployment order set to **"90"**.
